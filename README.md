# Walmart-Sales-Analysis-
Analysis of Walmart sales from Q1 2019, utilising SQL for data analysis and Tableau for data visualisation:
We obtained the data from a past Kaggle competition here:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/rules
We then utilised feature engineering in SQL to aid in data analysis
We further used Tableau for handy data visualtion
We then created a mock-report for Walmart using the insights we gained from the project
This project was done by Yahya Khan and Sai Ponnuru and our emails can be found on the PowerPoint report.
